## Product Goals

- Develop an efficient algorithm to solve the problem
- Ensure the solution is scalable for large inputs
- Optimize for the fastest execution time possible

## User Stories

- As a competitive programmer, I want to input my numbers and requests easily
- As a user, I want to quickly receive the k-th digit of MagicInteger for each request
- As a user, I want to see 'So sad' if the length of MagicInteger(l,v) is smaller than k
- As a user, I want the program to handle large inputs efficiently

## Competitive Analysis

- Codechef Problem Solvers: Fast execution but lacks user-friendly input methods
- HackerRank Code Challenges: Good user interface but slower execution for large inputs
- LeetCode Challenges: Efficient algorithms but can be intimidating for beginners
- GeeksforGeeks Practice: Comprehensive explanations but inconsistent execution times
- SPOJ: Supports multiple languages but user interface is outdated

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires an algorithm that can efficiently concatenate numbers based on given parameters and extract a specific digit from the concatenated string. Handling large inputs and executing requests quickly are critical for user satisfaction.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop the core algorithm to concatenate numbers and extract the specified digit.']
- ['P0', 'Implement input validation and error handling for out-of-bounds requests.']
- ['P1', 'Optimize the algorithm for time and space complexity.']
- ['P1', 'Design a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and requests.']
- ['P2', 'Include comprehensive documentation and examples for users.']

## UI Design draft

The UI will be simple and functional, focusing on ease of input for the numbers and requests. It will feature an input area for numbers, a separate section for entering requests, and a display area for the results. Error messages and prompts will guide the user for a smoother experience.
